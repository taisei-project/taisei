# Taisei Project – Game Manual

Taisei is a shoot-em-up game. Lots of bullets cover the screen and if you are hit by one, you die. To make things easier, your hitbox is very small, much smaller than your character.

If you get hit you lose a life (displayed on the right hand side in the HUD), if you are out of lives, it’s Game Over, but you get a few Continues to keep playing (without scores or replays).

## Controls

| Name  | Default Key                |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| Shoot | `Z`                        |
| Bomb  | `X`                        |
| Focus | `Left Shift`               |
| Move  | `Up`,`Down`,`Left`,`Right` |

Using the Gamepad is also supported. See options to set up controls.

Users of non-qwerty keyboard layouts: Don’t worry, Taisei’s controls are not based on layout but key location.

## Shotmodes

The different playable characters have different shots. You start out weak and
have to raise your power meter to get stronger.

Try a few modes to find the one that fits you best.

## Focus

While pressing `Shift`, your movement is slower and the weapon will be more
focused, hence the name *Focus* to describe this mode. It is useful for
accurate dodging, but you shouldn’t stay in this mode all the time.

The white circle appearing in this mode is a representation of your hitbox. As
you can see it is really small.

## HUD

The numbers in the HUD are

* **Score**
   Your current score. Raise this by shooting enemies, grazing, and collecting items.
   As you accumulate score, the game will reward you with life and bomb fragments. Be sure to catch those!
* **Player**
   How many lives you have. Only full stars count.
* **Bombs**
   How many bombs you have.
* **Power**
   How strong your current weapon is. Maxes out at 4.
* **Graze**
   If you are fearless and kiss bullets by going really close to them, this will increase and raise your score.

## Items

Killed enemies drop various amouts of items. They may look like bullets at first, but they are safe to touch.

These are:
* **Blue**
   Increases your score.
* **Red**
   Gives you more power.
* **Green Star**
   Bomb. Appears either filled (full bomb) or as an empty outline (bomb
   fragment). 5 fragments make up one bomb.
* **Pink Star**
   Life or Life fragment.

If you fly near to the top of the screen, all the visible items will be picked up (shown as flying towards you).

## Bosses

Taisei has 6 levels (called *stages*). Each stage has a boss and a midboss in some form. They are much stronger than normal enemies and have different attacks with time limits. There are different types of Attacks:

* **Normal**
   A signature move every boss has. They are a break between the other, more
   fierce attacks, but some say there are Normals in the game that are way
   too hard.
* **Spellcard**
   This is where the Bosses concentrate their powers (resulting in a background
   change) and hit you with really hard and unusual patterns.
   They give a lot of extra points when you *capture* them. That means shot
   down the hp within the time without getting hit or using bombs.

   You can revisit spellcards you have encountered in the *Spell Practice* mode
   to get better at the ones you frequently die on. 
* **Extra Spell**
   *Capture* every Spellcard of a boss in succession and you activate their *Extra Spell*.

   These are super hard, unique spells that will take all your skills and
   creativity to dodge. Special safety magic has locked your Bomb and Life meters so
   they can’t hurt you, but you can’t use your bombs either.
* **Survival Spell**
   Rarely, a very strong Boss can invoke a Spellcard that makes them completely
   invincible – turning their health bar blue.

   You are on your own here. Try to survive somehow until the timer runs up.

## Bombs

Your characters are of course no less apt at magic than the bosses, so they
have Spellcards of their own. These are called *bombs*.

You can use them to clear out bullets and enemies from the screen. However you
only get a limited amount, so they are best used when you are in a pinch. When
used against a boss Spellcard, it voids your capturing bonus.

Rumor has it that if you get hit by a bullet and hit the bomb key fast enough,
you can avoid death. This is called *Death Bombing* and people who master it –
so the lore goes – will find their bomb meter become a second life meter.

## Difficulty

~~If you found this guide helpful, you probably should start playing Easy mode.~~

Taisei is a very hard game, especially for newcomers to the genre. In many
modern games, *Easy* is a placeholder and *Normal* is the easy mode so people
playing it don’t have to feel bad. So you might feel inclined to start at
Normal like in your other games.

This approach doesn’t work for Taisei though. Easy is balanced around maybe
being not impossible for newcomers, so it’ll require some training. On the
positive side it still contains enough bullets to show you the beauty of all
the patterns. ;)

There is no shame in playing Easy. Some say that even the dev who initially
founded the project and wrote this section can’t beat Easy…
