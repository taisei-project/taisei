Taisei Project - Build Options
==============================

This is intended for anyone looking to build Taisei for any of its supported
operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Windows, Emscripten, Switch, and
others.

.. contents::

Checking Out Code
-----------------

First, you'll need to checkout the repository. You can do that with the
following:

.. code:: sh

   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei

The ``--recurse-submodules`` flag is absolutely necessary, or Taisei will not
build, as it will be missing many of the dependencies its needs to compile. If
you accidentally omit it during checkout, you can fix it with:

.. code:: sh

   cd taisei/
   git submodules update --init --recursive

Built-In vs. System Dependencies
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Due to the wide array of platforms Taisei supports, we provide meson
subprojects for its core dependencies using the
`Meson dependency wrap system <https://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html>`__.
This is to facilitate consistent build environments, including cross-builds,
and for more esoteric platforms like Emscripten.

For convenience, ``meson`` will detect which packages are missing from your
system and use its wrap dependency system to pull in what it can. Relying
on this is *not* recommended in most circumstances, and you should instead
rely on your operating system's package manager.

For consistency, we tend to release Taisei using exclusively built-in packages.
However, you can also use system dependencies as well. There's a tradeoff in
consistency and reproduceability for speed and ease of use.

This is controlled through the ``--wrap-mode`` flag with ``meson``. (More
on that later.)

Linux
'''''

On an Ubuntu or Debian-based distro, the following will install the mandatory
tools for building Taisei.

.. code:: sh

   apt update
   apt install meson cmake build-essential

Beyond that, consult the *Dependencies* list above. Many distros
package compile-time system dependencies with ``*-dev`` (i.e: ``libsdl2-dev``).
Search with your distro's package manager to install the correct libraries.

macOS
'''''

On macOS, you must install the Xcode Command Line Tools to build Taisei for
the platform, as it contains headers and tools for building native macOS apps.

.. code:: sh

   xcode-select --install

There are additional command line tools that you'll need. You can acquire those
by using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.

Follow the instructions for installing Homebrew, and then install the following
tools:

.. code:: sh

   brew install meson cmake pkg-config docutils pygments

You can then install dependencies from the *Dependencies* list.

As of 2021-08-05, you should **not** install the following packages via
Homebrew, as the versions available do not compile against Taisei correctly.
If you're having mysterious errors, ensure that they're not installed.

-  ``spirv-tools``
-  ``spirv-cross``

.. code:: sh

   brew remove spirv-tools spirv-cross

In addition, if you're trying to compile on an older version of macOS
(i.e: <10.12), SDL2 may not compile correctly on Homebrew (as of 2019-02-19).
Let ``meson`` pull in the corrected version for you via subprojects.

You can also install `create-dmg <https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg>`__
for packaging ``.dmg`` files, which enables some additional options such as
positioning of icons in the ``.dmg``.

Windows
'''''''

Taisei uses `mstorsjo/llvm-mingw <https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw>`__ to
achieve cross-compiling for Windows. Microsoft's native C compiler toolchain
simply does not support the things Taisei needs to compile correctly, including
fundamental things like
`complex numbers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number>`__.


You can use ``llvm-mingw`` too, or you can check if your distro has any
``mingw64`` cross-compiler toolchains available as well. That's is just the one
that works for us.

Additionally, you can install `nsis <https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page>`__
(>= 3.0) for packaging Windows installer ``.exe`` files. (However, you can
still package ``.zip`` files for Windows without it.)

On macOS, you're probably better off using Docker and the
`Docker container <https://hub.docker.com/r/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/>`__ that
``llvm-mingw`` provides, and installing ``nsis`` on top of it.

Another options for Windows-based computers is leveraging Windows
10's
`Windows For Linux (WSL) Subsystem <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`__
to cross-compile to Windows using their Ubuntu image. You can also potentially
use a ``mingw64`` toolchain directly on Windows, however that isn't supported
or recommended, as it's generally more trouble than its worth.

Build Options
-------------

This is *not* an exhaustive list. You can see the full list of option using
``meson`` in the ``taisei`` directory.

.. code:: sh

   cd taisei/
   meson configure

Setup
"""""

The first command you'll need to run is ``setup``, which creates a directory
(in this case, ``taisei/build/``). It checks your system for various
dependencies and required tools, which should take about a minute on most
systems.

.. code:: sh

   # inside the taisei/ directory you cloned before
   meson setup -C build/

You can also have the ``setup`` command contain certain build options (seen
below). The following are an *example* and *not required* for getting Taisei
building.

.. code:: sh

   # enables Developer Mode and debugging symbols
   meson setup -C build/ -Ddeveloper=true -Dbuildtype=debug

You can then apply more build options later using ``meson configure`` (as seen
below). It will automatically reconfigure your build environment with the new
options without having to rebuild everything.

System/Vendored Dependencies (``--wrap-mode``)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

See: `Meson Manual <https://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html>`__

* Default: ``default``
* Options: ``default``, ``nofallback``, ``forcefallback``, ...

This is a core ``meson`` flag that does quite a few things. Not all of them will
be covered here. Refer to the ``meson`` documentation linked above.

Generally, ``default`` will rely on system-installed libraries when available,
and download missing dependencies when necessary.

``forcefallback`` will force the use of wrapped dependencies whenever possible.
Recommended for release builds.

``nofallback`` disallows the use of wrapped dependencies whenever possible,
instead relying on system libraries. Useful for CI.

.. code:: sh

   # forces in-repo dependencies
   meson configure build/ --wrap-mode=forcefallback
   # disables in-repo repositories
   meson configure build/ --wrap-mode=nofallback

Relative Directory Install (``-Dinstall_relative``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``true`` or ``false`` (platform-dependent)

``-Dinstall_relative`` is a special option that changes depending on the
platform build target.

It is set to ``true`` when building for macOS, Windows, Emscripten, and Switch.

It is set to ``false`` when building for Linux.

Install Prefix (``--prefix``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``/usr/local``

``--prefix`` installs the Taisei binary and content files to a path of your
choice on your filesystem.

On Linux without ``-Dinstall_relative`` enabled (i.e: ``false``), it should be
kept to its default ``/usr/local``. In general, don't touch it unless you need
to.

On other platforms, it will install all Taisei game files to the directory of
your choice.

.. code:: sh

   meson setup --prefix=/path/goes/here -C build/

Package Data (``-Dpackage_data``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``auto``
* Options: ``auto``, ``true``, ``false``

Packages game data into either a directory or a ``.zip`` depending on if
``-Denable_zip`` is ``true`` (see below).

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Dpackage_data=false

Enable ZIP Loading (``-Denable_zip``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``true```
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

Controls whether or not Taisei can load game data (textures, shaders, etc) from
``.zip`` files. Useful for distribution and packaging.

**NOTE:** Setting this to ``false`` automatically disables ``-Dpackage_data``.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Denable_zip=false

In-Game Developer Options (``-Ddeveloper``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``false``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

For testing actual gameplay, you can set this option and it will enable cheats
and other 'fast-forward' options by the pressing keys defined in
``src/config.h``.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Ddeveloper=true

Build Type (``-Dbuildtype``)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``release``
* Options: ``release``, ``debug``

Sets the type of build. ``debug`` enables several additional debugging features,
as well as reduced optimizations and more debugging symbols.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Dbuildtype=debug

Assertions (``-Db_ndebug``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``true``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

The name of this flag is opposite of what you'd expect. Think of it as "Not
Debugging". It controls the ``NDEBUG`` declaration which is responsible for
deactivating ``assert()`` macros.

Setting to ``false`` will *enable* assertions (i.e: good for debugging).

Keep ``true`` during release.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Db_ndebug=false

Strict Compiler Warnings (``-Dwerror``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``false``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

This option forces stricter checks against Taisei's codebase to ensure code
health, treating all ``Warnings`` as ``Errors`` in the code.

It's highly recommended to **enable** (i.e: ``true``) this whenever developing
for the engine. Sometimes, it's overly-pedantic, but much of the time, it
provides useful advice. (For example, it can detect potential null-pointer
exceptions that may not be obvious to the human eye.)

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Dwerror=true

Deprecation Warnings (``-Ddeprecation_warnings``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``default``
* Options: ``error``, ``no-error``, ``ignore``, ``default``

Sets deprecation warnings to either hard-fail (``error``), print as warnings but
not trigger full errors if ``-Dwerror=true`` (``no-error``), and otherwise
ignore them (``ignore``). ``default`` respects the ``-Dwerror`` setting.

Generally, ``no-error`` is the recommended default when using ``-Dwerror=true``.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Ddeprecation_warnings=no-error


Debugging With Sanitizers (``-Db_sanitize``)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is useful for debugging memory management errors, leaks, and undefined behavior.
However, there is some additional setup required to use it.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Db_sanitize=address,undefined

Depending on your platform, you may need to specify the specific library binary
to use to launch ASan appropriately. Using macOS as an example:

.. code:: sh

   export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/12.0.5/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib

The ``../12.0.5/..`` in the path of ``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`` changes with each
version of Xcode. If it fails to launch for you, ensure that the version number
is correct by browsing to the parent directory of ``../clang``.

Then, you can launch Taisei's binary from the command line (using macOS as an
example):

.. code:: sh

   /path/to/Taisei.app/Contents/MacOS/Taisei

Further reading: `Sanitizers <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki>`__

Link-Time Optimizations (``-Db_lto``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``true``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

Link-time optimizations (LTO) increase build times, but also increase
performance. For quicker build times during development, you can disable it.
For release builds, this should be kept ``true``.

See: `Interprocedural Optimization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization#WPO_and_LTO>`__

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Db_lto=false

Binary Striping (``-Dstrip``)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Default: ``true``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

This option prevents stripping of the `taisei` binary, providing a marginally
faster build time.

Keep this ``true`` during releases, but ``false`` during development, as it will
strip out useful debugging symbols.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Db_strip=false

Rendering
"""""""""

Backends (``-Dr_gl*``)
''''''''''''''''''''''

* Default: ``false``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

Enable or disable the various renderer backends for Taisei.

``-Dshader_transpiler`` is required for when OpenGL ES is used.

.. code:: sh

   # for GL 3.3 (default)
   meson configure build/ -Dr_gl33=true
   # for GL ES 3.0
   meson configure build/ -Dr_gles30=true
   # for GL ES 2.0 (not recommended)
   meson configure build/ -Dr_gles20=true

**NOTE:** GL ES 2.0 is *not recommended* as it is unsupported and may
not work correctly. However, if for some reason you still want to use it,
it requires a few extensions to be present on your system to function
correctly, most notably:

- ``OES_depth_texture`` or ``GL_ANGLE_depth_texture``
- ``OES_standard_derivatives``
- ``OES_vertex_array_object``
- ``EXT_frag_depth``
- ``EXT_instanced_arrays`` or ``ANGLE_instanced_arrays`` or
  ``NV_instanced_arrays``

Default Renderer (``-Dr_default``)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Default: ``gl33``
* Options: ``gl33``, ``gles30``, ``gles20``, ``null``

Sets the default renderer to use when Taisei launches.

.. code:: sh

   # for GL 3.3 (default)
   meson configure build/ -Dr_default=gl33
   # for GL ES 3.0
   meson configure build/ -Dr_default=gles30
   # for GL ES 2.0 (not recommended)
   meson configure build/ -Dr_default=gles20

You can switch the renderer using the ``--renderer`` flag on the ``taisei``
binary. (i.e: ``taisei --renderer gl33``).

Shader Transpiler (``-Dshader_transpiler``)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Default: ``false``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

For using OpenGL ES, the shader transpiler is necessary for converting Taisei's
shaders to a format usable by that driver.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Dshader_transpiler=true

ANGLE
"""""

Building ANGLE (Optional)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
`ANGLE <https://github.com/google/angle>`__ is Google's graphics translation
layer, intended for for Chromium. Taisei packages it with Windows builds to
workaround some bugs and performance issues with many Windows OpenGL drivers,
and it can be optionally packaged as as an experimental Metal renderer for
macOS.

You need to read
`this guide <https://github.com/google/angle/blob/master/doc/DevSetup.md>`__ and
set up Google's custom build system to get things going. However, the below
commands might help you compiling what you need from it when you have that all
set up.

.. code:: sh

   cd angle
   python ./scripts/bootstrap.py
   gclient sync
   gn gen out/x64 --args='is_debug=false dcheck_always_on=false target_cpu="x64"'
   ninja -C out/x64 libEGL libGLESv2

It will output two files to ``angle/out/x64``:

* ``libEGL.(*)``
* ``libGLESv2.(*)``

The file extension can be ``.dll`` for Windows, ``.dylib`` for macOS,
and ``.so`` for Linux.

Using ``-Dinstall_angle`` and ``-Dangle_lib*`` (see below), ``meson`` will copy
those files over into the package itself when running the packaging steps.

ANGLE Library Paths (``-Dangle_lib*``)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Default: ``(null)``
* Options: ``/path/to/libGLESv2.{dll,dylib,so}``/``path/to/libEGL.{dll,dylib,so}``

``-Dangle_libgles`` and ``-Dangle_libegl`` provide the full paths to the ANGLE
libraries necessary for that engine.

Generally, both need to be supplied at the same time.

.. code:: sh

   # for macOS
   meson configure build/ -Dangle_libgles=/path/to/libGLESv2.dylib -Dangle_libegl=/path/to/libEGL.dylib
   # for Linux
   meson configure build/ -Dangle_libgles=/path/to/libGLESv2.so -Dangle_libegl=/path/to/libEGL.so
   # for Windows
   meson configure build/ -Dangle_libgles=/path/to/libGLESv2.dll -Dangle_libegl=/path/to/libEGL.dll

Install ANGLE (``-Dinstall_angle``)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

* Default: ``false``
* Options: ``true``, ``false``

Installs the ANGLE libraries supplied above through ``-Dangle_lib*``.

Generally recommended when packaging ANGLE for distribution.

.. code:: sh

   meson configure build/ -Dinstall_angle=true
