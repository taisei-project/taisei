How to use controllers, such as gamepads, with Taisei.

Controller Support
------------------

Supported Controllers
"""""""""""""""""""""

Taisei uses SDL2's unified
`GameController API <https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryGameController>`__.
This allows us to correctly support any device that SDL recognizes by default,
while treating all of them the same way. The vast majority of USB Human
Interface Devices should be supported by this method, especially ones made in
the last 15 years or so, once the overall USB ecosystem began to stabilize.

Unsupported Controllers
"""""""""""""""""""""""

If, for some reason, your device isn't supported by SDL2's GameController API, such as
a particularly old or perhaps custom-made game controller using a unique interface, you'll
need to provide it a custom controller mapping.

There are a few ways to generate a custom mapping:

-  You can use the
   `controllermap <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/controllermap>`__ utility,
   which `comes with SDL source code
   <https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/68a767ae3a88/test/controllermap.c>`__.
-  If you use Steam, you can configure your controller there. Then you can add
   Taisei as a non-Steam game; run it from Steam and everything should *just
   workâ„¢*. In case you don't want to do that, find ``config/config.vdf`` in your
   Steam installation directory, and look for the ``SDL_GamepadBind`` variable.
   It contains a list of SDL mappings separated by line breaks.
-  You can also try the `SDL2 Gamepad Tool by General Arcade
   <http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/>`__. This program is free to use,
   but not open source.
-  Finally, you can try to write a mapping by hand. You will probably have to
   refer to the SDL documentation. See `gamecontrollerdb.txt
   <misc/gamecontrollerdb/gamecontrollerdb.txt>`__ for some more examples.

Whether you use one of the above tools, or hand-roll one yourself, the mapping
should look something like this:

::

    03000000ba2200002010000001010000,Jess Technology USB Game Controller,a:b2,b:b1,back:b8,dpdown:h0.4,dpleft:h0.8,dpright:h0.2,dpup:h0.1,guide:,leftshoulder:b4,lefttrigger:b6,leftx:a0,lefty:a1,rightshoulder:b5,righttrigger:b7,rightx:a3,righty:a2,start:b9,x:b3,y:b0,

Once you have your mapping, there are two ways to make Taisei use it:

-  Create a file named ``gamecontrollerdb.txt`` where your config, replays and
   screenshots are, and put each mapping on a new line.
-  Put your mappings in the environment variable ``SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG``,
   also separated by line breaks. Other games that use the GameController API
   will also pick them up.

When you're done, please consider contributing your mappings to
`SDL <https://libsdl.org/>`__,
`SDL_GameControllerDB <https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB>`__,
and `us <https://github.com/taisei-project/SDL_GameControllerDB>`__, so
that other people can benefit from your work.

Also note that we currently only handle input from analog axes and
analog/digital buttons. Anything more exotic, such as hats, probably wont work
out of the box.
